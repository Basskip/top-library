# JavaScript Library App

A project from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/library) curriculum, creating a small Library app to learn some JavaScript

## Things I learned
* The basics of using localStorage to persist data
* Adding functions to a JavaScript object through its prototype

## Things to work on
* No styling
